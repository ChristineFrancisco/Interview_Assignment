Part 1: Question 4. JSON to HTML
If the header "Patient Data" is displaying, but the JSON data does not, this is because the files need to be either in a public folder or hosted on a live server for the FETCH API to work. 
I used https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related?hl=en this google chrome extension to serve the folder. 
For more information on the FETCH API, you can check out this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50007055/fetch-request-to-local-file-not-working/50007208#50007208.
